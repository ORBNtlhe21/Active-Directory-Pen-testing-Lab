# Active-Directory-Pen-testing-Lab
This project simulates a real-world internal penetration test in a controlled lab environment. The goal is to compromise a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller using a Kali Linux attacker machine through enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation techniques.

Project Summary

- **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux
- **Target Machine:** Windows Server 2022 (Active Directory Domain Controller)
- **Domain Name:** `orb.corp0`
